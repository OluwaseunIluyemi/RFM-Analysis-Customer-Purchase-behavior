/*     Customer Segmentation:
Problem: How can we segment our customer base to better understand their behavior and needs?
Questions: Can you group customers based on their recency, frequency, and monetary value? What are
the different customer segments that emerge from the analysis?

Recency (R)
Definition: How recently a customer made a purchase or engaged with the business.
Tables required: Sales.SalesOrderHeader, salesOrderDetail.
Columns required:  CustomerID, and OrderDate 

1.Customer ID or Unique Identifier: An identifier for each customer that allows me to link their recency,frequency, and monetary value 
  to their individual profiles.
2.Date of Last Interaction: The date when the customer last interacted with your business, made a purchase, or engaged in any meaningful 
  activity. This will be used to calculate the recency score.
  Once have these columns, the recency scores can be calculated based on the difference between the current date and the date of the last 
  interaction for each customer.

A) table for question 1 containing all columns needed. created a temporary table  #RFM  by selecting specific
column from the salesoOrderheader and salesOrderDetail. which includes CustomerId,OrderDate,SalesOrderID,ProductID
OrderQty,UnitPrice,LineTotal for each sales */

SELECT

INNER JOIN [Sales].[SalesOrderDetail] b 
ON a.[SalesOrderID] = b.[SalesOrderID]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SELECT * FROM #RFM 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/*B) RECENCY:This code calculate the the differecnce in days btw the maxinum order date for each customers
and the specified date ('2015-01-01').It stores the customerID and date diff in a temp #numberofdays
The saleOrdertable is use to calc the max order date for each customer.the DATEDIFF compute the diff
in days btw the Maxorderdate and "2015-01-01".the resultare then store in temp table #numberofdays */

--declare today's date (Date of my analysis)
DECLARE @today_date AS DATE = '2015-01-01'

SELECT

  DATEDIFF(day,MAX([Orderdate]),'2015-01-01')AS datedifference

FROM [Sales].[SalesOrderHeader]m
GROUP BY [CustomerID]
ORDER BY MAX([OrderDate])DESC

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SELECT * FROM #numberofdays
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


/* C) FREQUENCY
Definition: How often a customer makes purchases or engages with your business.
Tables required: Sales.SalesOrderHeader
Columns required:  CustomerID, SalesorderID, and OrderDate 

1.	Customer ID or Unique Identifier: An identifier for each customer that allows you to link their recency, frequency, and monetary value to their individual profiles.
2.	Transaction/Purchase ID: An identifier for each transaction or purchase made by the customer.
3.	Date of Transaction/Purchase: The date when each transaction or purchase was made. This will be used to calculate the frequency score.

Once i have these columns,i calculated the frequency score based on the number of transactions or purchases made by each customer within a specified time frame.

This SQL code calculate the purchase frequency(SumofPurchaseCount)for each customerby counting the number of sales ordersthey made 
btw '2013-01-01' and '2015-01-01'.the result are grouped by customer and the total purchase frequency is obtained for each customer, ordered in desc orderbased on the total purchase freq.
The COUNTFRQ common Table Expression(CTE) calculates the purchase freq for each customer based on their
distinct sale within a specified date range. the final SELECT statement aggregates the purchase freq for each 
customer, stores result in #SUMFRQ temp table, ordered it by total purchase freqin DESC order */

SELECT * FROM #SumFrq

/*D)  Monetary Value (M):
Definition: The amount of money a customer has spent on purchases.
Tables required: Sales.SalesOrderHeader & Sales.SalesOrderDetail
Columns required: CustomerID, SalesOrderID, OrderDate, OrderQty, and Unit price

1.Customer ID or Unique Identifier: An identifier for each customer that allows you to link their recency, frequency, and monetary value to their individual profiles.
2.Transaction/Purchase ID: An identifier for each transaction or purchase made by the customer.
3.Amount Spent: The monetary value associated with each transaction or purchase made by the customer. This could be the total amount spent in that transaction.
  Once you have these columns, you can calculate the monetary value score based on the total amount spent by each customer over a specified time frame or for their entire history as relevant to your analysis.

This code calculate the total amount spent (total_spent) by each customer within the date of
January 1,2015, by multiplying orderquantity(ORDERQty)with the unit price (UnitPrice).The result are grouped by customeID 
and stored in a temp table named #totalamtspent */
