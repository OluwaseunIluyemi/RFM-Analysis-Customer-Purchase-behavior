# RFM-Analysis-Customer-Purchase-behavior

RFM analysis is a marketing technique used to analyze and categorize customers based on their transactional behavior. The acronym RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value, which are three key dimensions used to evaluate customer behavior.
Recency (R): This measures how recently a customer has made a purchase. 
Frequency (F): This looks at how often a customer makes a purchase.
Monetary Value (M): This dimension assesses the monetary value of a customer's transactions.
By understanding the Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value of the customer base, businesses can optimize their marketing efforts, enhance customer retention, and maximize the overall effectiveness of their marketing strategies.
